* Fixed a long-standing bug where differing end-of-line conventions
  could cause bogus comparisons in signature checks.

* Fixed another long-standing bug where CRLF text files were hashed

[Changes for 0.53 - 2006-01-31]

* The explicit call to "readline(D)" didn't compile on earlier perls which

  you can now override this by settings MODULE_SIGNATURE_CIPHER
  environment variable to SHA256.

[Changes for 0.45 - 2005-08-09]

* Andreas Koenig ported out that "Import GPG keys?" was asked
  far too many times during autoinstall.

[Changes for 0.44 - 2004-12-16]

  early Win32 hacks.  Reported by Steve Hay via Michael Schwern.

  in addition to the original Digest::SHA1 backend.

* We now asks before importing the default keys,
  also suggested by Tels.

* Unknown cipher is made fatal, thanks to suggestion by Tels.

* Apply Dave Rolsky's patch to verify that author's pubkey
  is available on a keyserver. may need more work.

[Changes for 0.38 - 2004-01-01]

* Update to the newest Module::Install.

* Not using inc/SCRIPT/ anymore.

* Add "#defaults" and "^blibdirs$" to recommended MANIFEST.SKIP
  to pacify newer ExtUtil::MakeMaker.

  C compiler anyway.

* ExtUtils::Manifest 1.38 does not support good enough skips even
  for Makefile.PL, sigh.

[Changes for 0.33 - 2003-08-12]

* William Wentworth-Sheilds points out that META.yml is dynamic,
  which makes SIGNATURE incorrect for people without either "diff"
  or "gpg".  Fixed.

[Changes for 0.30 - 2003-08-10]

* Add JHI to authors.

* Patch from Michael Schwern: only let GnuPG display anything
  if we're handling suspicious keys, not when you have added
  the signer into the trustdb.

* New global config variable, $Verbose.

* MODULE_SIGNATURE_VERBOSE, MODULE_SIGNATURE_KEYSERVER and
  MODULE_SIGNATURE_KEYSERVERPORT env variables are now respected.

* Only supply _default_skip if our ExtUtils::MakeMaker is too old.

* Now fails gracefully all the time, including when incapable of
  connecting to the keyserver.

* Also, SHA1 sum is still checked even if the user does not have
  GnuPg/Crypt::OpenPGP.

  for users without gnupg.

* Do not die() when we absolutely can't verify.

* BZAJAC pointed out that we should add .svn to _default_skip.

[Changes for 0.28 - 2003-07-29]

* Remove Digest.pm dependency.

  have -version, thanks again to Alan Burlison.

* More punctuation cleanups in POD.

* Michael Schwern pointed out that successful tests shouldn't be noisy.

[Changes for 0.26 - 2003-07-17]

  argument, eliminating the "local $Module::Signautre::SIGNATURE" approach.

  about whether to respect MANIFEST.SKIP.  This needs to be
  set to 0 to sign blib/ archives.

* Officially supporting signing and verification of PAR files, using PAR::Dist.

* Let's ignore warnings when performing on exe files

[Changes for 0.24 - 2003-07-08]

  older versions of GnuPG, as reported by Tels.

[Changes for 0.17 - 2002-10-30]

  manifest mismatch if SIGNATURE is lacking.

* Also, bail out gracefully when signing fails, instead of crippling the
  old SIGNATURE.

* MANIFEST.SKIP doc lifted from Test::Signature.

* Minor POD fixups.

  package variable should disable automatic key-fetching.

* Include the tests from Iain.

* Tels: disable KeyServer fetching if it's undef'ed.

[Changes for 0.07 - 2002-10-11]

* Fixed our own signatures.

[Changes for 0.06 - 2002-10-10]

* Use many-arg system() instead of the one-arg form to prevent security breach.

* Iain Truskett: fixed export bug so SIGNATURE_OK is properly exported.

* Introduced global $KeyServer variable, default at 'pgp.mit.edu'.
