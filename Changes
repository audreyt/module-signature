  far too many times during autoinstall.

  is available on a keyserver. may need more work.

[Changes for 0.38 - 2004-01-01]

* Update to the newest Module::Install.

* Not using inc/SCRIPT/ anymore.

  for Makefile.PL, sigh.

[Changes for 0.33 - 2003-08-12]

* William Wentworth-Sheilds points out that META.yml is dynamic,
  which makes SIGNATURE incorrect for people without either "diff"

  if we're handling suspicious keys, not when you have added
  the signer into the trustdb.

  MODULE_SIGNATURE_KEYSERVERPORT env variables are now respected.

* Michael Schwern pointed out that successful tests shouldn't be noisy.

  set to 0 to sign blib/ archives.

  older versions of GnuPG, as reported by Tels.

* Also, bail out gracefully when signing fails, instead of crippling the
  old SIGNATURE.

* Tels: disable KeyServer fetching if it's undef'ed.

[Changes for 0.07 - 2002-10-11]

* Fixed our own signatures.

[Changes for 0.06 - 2002-10-10]
